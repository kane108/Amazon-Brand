                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>We are a small company who believes that a <br>
                    pet's mental health is just as important as its <br>
                    physical health. Boredom and anxiety are <br>
                    common traits among petS that are not <br>
                    challenged enough mentally â€” and we see this <br>
                    manifest as "bad" and destructive behavior.</p>
                <p>That's why we at FunPetz are singularly focused <br>
                    on finding products that can keep your pet <br>
                    physically and mentally engaged.</p>
